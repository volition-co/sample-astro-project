Introducing Superconductor: Your Autonomous Product Organization

Why aren't your agents working right now?

We've been thinking about this question a lot. You have AI coding assistants. Maybe you're using tab completion, agentic sidebars, even CLI agents. But when you close your laptop, they stop. Your product development freezes. Bug reports pile up. Customer requests sit unread. Competitive intelligence goes unnoticed.

Your agents should always be working.

Today, we're excited to share our vision for Superconductor: software that orchestrates an autonomous product organization—one that never stops building, improving, and shipping.

Three Core Capabilities

1. Proactive, Ambient Listening

Superconductor gathers input from everywhere your product needs to evolve:

- Customer support emails and conversations
- Bug reports from Sentry and error monitoring
- User session replays showing friction points
- News about competitors and market shifts
- Internal discussions: meetings, Slack messages, Notion docs
- Your own product ideas

Every input is analyzed. If something is actionable, work begins automatically—no ticket required.

2. Always Unblocked

A single coding agent isn't enough for real product development. You need a full team:

- PM agents to clarify requirements
- Designer agents to maintain your design system
- Dev agents to implement features
- QA agents to test implementations
- Review agents for code quality, security, and accessibility
- Deployment agents to manage feature flags and rollouts
- Unblocking agents that identify and resolve bottlenecks

When an agent hits a blocker—missing API key, unclear requirement, design constraint—Superconductor surfaces it to you and learns to prevent it next time.

4. Complete Visibility

You maintain control with full observability:

- Click into any agent's work to see exactly what happened
- Review and approve at crucial decision points
- Watch deployments with feature flags and monitoring
- Understand the full workflow from input to shipped feature
- You're not dealing with a black box. You're running your product development like you'd play StarCraft—with strategic oversight of parallel workstreams.

Hire the Best Agent for Each Task
Superconductor isn't tied to a single AI model. We orchestrate the best tool for each job—Claude Code for certain tasks, Codex for others, Gemini when appropriate. Your agents work together as a coordinated team.

Software That Builds Itself

Imagine:
A customer reports a bug → Agent reproduces it, fixes it, runs tests, and deploys with a feature flag → You review the fix in production
Session replay shows users struggling with a workflow → Design and dev agents collaborate on an improvement → You approve and it ships
Competitor launches a feature → Agents draft a spec and implementation plan → Your team weighs in on priority

This isn't about replacing your team. It's about multiplying your leverage—ensuring every signal becomes action and no opportunity is missed.

What's Next

We're building this vision step by step, starting with customers who want their agents to work harder and smarter. If you're tired of your AI tools sitting idle, if you want an autonomous product org that actually works 24/7, we'd love to talk.
Your AI product team is here. It's time to put it to work.
